# Frontend (placeholder for Step 1)

In **Step 2**, we'll scaffold a React app (Vite) and connect to the backend.

## Planned commands (to run later)
```bash
# create app
npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

We'll implement:
- Login (JWT)
- Word List & Details
- Add Word form
